TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Learnt how to do basic python and coding thinking.

Still unclear whether test results should be printing the correct thing (cause windows can't support curse B)).

In a more serious note, using str() is more understanding than other methods but less practical.
