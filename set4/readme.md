TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

In Modes:
r = read, Cannot be used to edit files
w = write, Can be used to edit files

Reading through dictionaries can get difficult, if list has [] then integer listing required and 
{} then requires key listings.

Parsing through internet values is helpful in extracting data without using unnecessary storage
