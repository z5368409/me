TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Fixed dataset by skipping rows 0 and 1 and setting header = 1.
This work is still in "basic_pandas" assignment test folder so its best recommended to
move it after I created separate repo.

Maps is currently broken since pipwin descartes, six and geopandas are missing (from terminal),
that option is not available yet.
